## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button at the top of the screen, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

The first code chunk above sets options so that the output document will include code as well as its output (`echo = T`), and so that the document will still run even if there are errors (`error = T`).

To complete this exercise, fill in the blanks ("___") in the code chunks below. Please knit the document to turn it in. To add notes or text, type in the space outside of the code chunks (like right here!). 

## Section 1: Directories and packages

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

##############  Section 1: Working with Directories and Projects ##############
# What is your current working directory?
getwd()
# Pull up the help page for this function
?getwd #Note the absence of parentheses when pulling up the help page

# Set your working directory (if needed)
 setwd("C:/Users/olive/Documents/datamngmt")  # Uncomment and fill in if you want to manually set your working directory
# If working in an R project, you should not need to use getwd() and setwd()

# Identify files in your working directory
dir()

# Create a new folder called "data" within this directory (if it doesn't exist)
dir.create("data") #add folder name "data" here
# Check that this worked: do you see a new entry with your chosen folder name?
dir()

# BONUS: list files in one directory above and one directory below this one
dir("../") #../navigates up
dir("___") #directory name
```

## Section 2: Simple vectors

```{r}
# Assign a value to a variable
my_name <- ("Oliver")  # your name as a character string

# Print your name
print(my_name)

# What is the class of the variable you just created?
class(my_name)

# What else do you want to know about this variable?
length(my_name)
nchar(my_name)

# Create a numeric vector
my_vector <- c(3, 6, 5)

# Get the length of the vector
length(my_vector)

# Get the mean of the vector
mean(my_vector)

# Add another number to the numeric vector
my_vector <- c(my_vector, 7)

# Get the length of the vector
length(my_vector)
```

What does the `length` of the `my_name` vector describe? (e.g., number of words, number of letters, length of name, number of names, ...)

> it describes the number of words

## Section 3: Working with data frames

```{r}
# Create a data frame with two columns: species and count
my_data <- data.frame(
  species = c("oak", "pine", "maple"),
  count = c(7, 8, 10) # Add arbitrary numbers here
)

# View the structure of the data frame
str(my_data)

# Access the "species" column
pull(my_data, species)
# Alternatively, access the "species" column using base R
my_data$species

# Access the count of pines
pines <- filter(my_data, species == "pine")
str(pines)
pine_count <- pull(pines,count )
print(pine_count)

# Or, do this using base R
pine_row <- which(my_data$species =="pine")
str(pine_row)
# base R uses square brackets to access rows and columns:
# data[1,2] accesses the first row and second column.
# You can also use row names and column names
pine_count <- my_data["2", "count"]
print(pine_count)
```

Create a new `my_data` data frame with **four** tree species:

```{r}

```

## Section 4: Bigger data frames

```{r}
# Load some data that is built into R

# What datasets are built into R?
library(help = "datasets")
# These can be useful to know about for testing code or plotting functions

# Today, we will use the PlantGrowth dataset
PlantGrowth

# View the first few rows
head(PlantGrowth)

# Check the column names
names(PlantGrowth)

# Summarize the dataset
summary(PlantGrowth)

# We will get into plotting later, but here's an example:
boxplot(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth, main = "PlantGrowth data",
        ylab = "Dried weight of plants", col = "lightgray")
```

In the output of `summary()`, what does the `group` summary tell you?

> it tells you the number of each type of group 

What does this plot suggest about the results of the study?

> trt1 has a lower mean than the control and trt2 has a higher mean than the control

## Section 5: Open-ended practice

```{r}
# Pick another dataset from the datasets help page
str(ChickWeight)
head(ChickWeight)
summary(ChickWeight)
class(ChickWeight)

# What type of object is this data set?
##Numeric

# If it is a data frame or matrix:
## How many columns does it have?
##4

## What are the column names?
##weight, time, chick, diet 

## What is the mean of the first numeric column?
##Mean of the weight column is 121.8 

# If it is a numeric or integer vector:
## How many elements does it have?
___
## What is the mean value?
___
## Add another element to this vector:
___

```
